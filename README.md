## 💬 Why This Exists

> *"I wanted to play a Tabaxi Ranger, but Volo's Guide costs $30 on my perfered character manager. This tool gave me every race, every spell, completely free."*
> — Player from my campaign

**Built by a DM who was tired of:**
- **$400+ to own all D&D content on some sites** - Races, classes, and spells locked behind paywalls
- **Subscription fatigue** - Monthly fees for "unlimited characters"
- **No offline access** - Dependence on internet connectivity
- **Privacy concerns** - Tools that track your gameplay and sell data

**The DM's Toolbox solves all of this:**
- ✅ All 33+ races, 13 classes, 432 spells - **FREE**
- ✅ No accounts, no tracking, no data collection
- ✅ Works completely offline after first load
- ✅ Generators for instant improvisation at the table

This is a personal hobby project created for GMs and players who want practical utility without overhead.
